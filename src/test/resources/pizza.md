Here are the top 5 essential ingredients for a classic Italian pizza:

1.  **Dough/Flour**
    * The base for any authentic pizza, traditionally made with fine **"00" flour**, water, yeast, and salt.

2.  **Tomato Sauce (San Marzano Tomatoes)**
    * Simple sauce made from high-quality crushed **San Marzano tomatoes** (or similar Italian plum tomatoes), often seasoned only with a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil.

3.  **Mozzarella Cheese**
    * Fresh cheese, most commonly **Fior di Latte** (cow's milk mozzarella) or **Mozzarella di Bufala** (buffalo milk mozzarella), torn or sliced, not shredded.

4.  **Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)**
    * A quality drizzle of olive oil is essential both in the dough, in the sauce, and often applied to the pizza *before* or *after* baking.

5.  **Fresh Basil**
    * Fresh basil leaves are added near the end of the bake or immediately after, providing the iconic green colour and aromatic finish of a true Margherita.
