Here are the top 5 essential ingredients for a classic Italian pizza:

• *Dough/Flour*

- The base for any authentic pizza, traditionally made with fine *"00" flour*, water, yeast, and salt\.
• *Tomato Sauce \(San Marzano Tomatoes\)*

- Simple sauce made from high\-quality crushed *San Marzano tomatoes* \(or similar Italian plum tomatoes\), often seasoned only with a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil\.
• *Mozzarella Cheese*

- Fresh cheese, most commonly *Fior di Latte* \(cow's milk mozzarella\) or *Mozzarella di Bufala* \(buffalo milk mozzarella\), torn or sliced, not shredded\.
• *Extra Virgin Olive Oil \(EVOO\)*

- A quality drizzle of olive oil is essential both in the dough, in the sauce, and often applied to the pizza _before_ or _after_ baking\.
• *Fresh Basil*

- Fresh basil leaves are added near the end of the bake or immediately after, providing the iconic green colour and aromatic finish of a true Margherita\.
